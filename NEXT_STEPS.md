### Next Steps

1.  **Run Verification:** Execute the full `pytest` suite to confirm all tests pass and to get an updated code coverage report.
2.  **Analyze Coverage:** Identify the remaining files with coverage below the 80% project threshold.
3.  **Increase Coverage:** Systematically add unit tests to the identified files, prioritizing those with the lowest coverage, until the overall coverage meets or exceeds 80%.
4.  **Final Review:** Once the coverage target is met and all tests pass, the project should be clear of the errors and ready for you to push.
