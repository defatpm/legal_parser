# Project Progress Tracker
*Medical Record Pre-Processor Development*

## Project Overview
Building an intelligent medical record pre-processor that transforms monolithic PDFs into timeline-ready, AI-friendly structured data.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Processing Engine (Backend Logic)
**Status:** âœ… Completed

#### High-Priority Setup Tasks
- [x] Set up project structure with proper directories (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
- [x] Create Python virtual environment and requirements files
- [x] Set up development tools (Black, Ruff, Mypy, pre-commit)

#### Core Implementation Tasks
- [x] Create core PDF processing module structure
- [x] Implement file ingestion and text extraction (Step 1)
- [x] Implement document segmentation and noise filtering (Step 2)
- [x] Implement metadata extraction per segment (Step 3)
- [x] Implement chronological sorting and chunking (Step 4)

#### Testing & Quality
- [x] Create basic test suite with sample data
- [x] Resolve syntax errors and improve test suite
- [x] Increase test coverage to 70%

### Phase 2: User Interface (Frontend Application)
**Status:** ðŸ”® Planned
- Flask backend API
- Web-based UI with drag-and-drop upload
- Progress tracking and results display

### Phase 3: Testing, Validation, and Iteration
**Status:** ðŸ”® Planned
- Sample data testing
- Validation metrics
- User feedback integration

## Current Sprint
**Focus:** Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Testing & Phase 2 Planning

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Install dependencies and test the core pipeline
2. âœ… Create sample test data and validate processing
3. Begin Phase 2 (Web UI) planning and implementation
4. Set up continuous integration

## Development Environment Ready
- âœ… Virtual environment created and activated
- âœ… All dependencies installed including spaCy model
- âœ… Git repository initialized with proper .gitignore
- âœ… Pre-commit hooks configured
- âœ… Test suite created and passing (70% coverage)
- âœ… Sample data created and pipeline validated

## Core Components Implemented
- **PDF Extraction**: PyMuPDF + OCR fallback with Tesseract
- **Document Segmentation**: Regex-based boundary detection + noise filtering
- **Metadata Extraction**: spaCy NLP + pattern matching for dates, providers, document types
- **Timeline Building**: Chronological sorting + intelligent chunking for AI processing
- **Main Pipeline**: Complete end-to-end processing with CLI interface
