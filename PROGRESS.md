## Recent Bug Fixes & Maintenance ✅

### Python 3.9 Compatibility Fix ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Completed
**Actual Time:** 1 hour
**Completed:** 2025-07-11

**Issue:** Push error due to Python 3.10+ union type syntax (`|`) being used in `error_handler.py:239` when targeting Python 3.9 compatibility.

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced all Python 3.10+ union syntax (`|`) with `typing.Union` for Python 3.9 compatibility
- Updated type annotations throughout `error_handler.py`:
  - `T | Any` → `Union[T, Any]`
  - `Any | None` → `Union[Any, None]`
  - `dict[str, Any] | None` → `Union[dict[str, Any], None]`
  - `Callable[[Exception], bool] | None` → `Union[Callable[[Exception], bool], None]`
  - `str | None` → `Union[str, None]`
  - `float | None` → `Union[float, None]`
- Added `Union` import to typing imports

**Files Modified:**
- `src/utils/error_handler.py` - Fixed type annotations for Python 3.9 compatibility

**Notes:** Critical fix for maintaining Python 3.9 compatibility across the codebase. All type annotations now use the older `typing.Union` syntax instead of the newer `|` operator introduced in Python 3.10.
