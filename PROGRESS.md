# Project Progress & Milestones

This document tracks the major architectural and refactoring milestones completed for the `legal_parser` project.

### **Milestone 1: Architectural Refinement (Completed)**

**Date:** 2025-07-11

**Objective:** To establish a robust, scalable, and maintainable project structure and processing workflow.

#### **Key Achievements:**

1.  **Optimized Directory Structure:**
    -   **Status:** Complete
    -   **Details:** The project layout was updated to follow the standard `src-layout` for better separation of concerns. Key modules for the API, processing logic, core models, and web UI are now clearly organized.
    -   **Reference:** `proposed_directory_structure.md`

2.  **Modular Processing Pipeline:**
    -   **Status:** Complete
    -   **Details:** Refactored the core logic into a `ProcessingPipeline`. This pipeline orchestrates modular components (`TextExtractor`, `Segmenter`, etc.) using dependency injection. This design improves testability and maintains a strong separation of concerns.
    -   **Reference:** `proposed_mod_processor.md`

3.  **Decoupled Web UI:**
    -   **Status:** Complete
    -   **Details:** The Streamlit web interface was redesigned to be a thin presentation layer. It is now fully decoupled from the backend, delegating all processing tasks to the `ProcessingPipeline`. This simplifies the UI code and makes the entire system more robust.

### **Next Steps:**

With the new architecture defined, the next phase of work will focus on implementing these designs and tackling the items outlined in the **[Improvement Roadmap](./other_suggestions.md)**.
