# Medical Record Pre-Processor Development Plan

This is a well-structured Python project that processes medical record PDFs into structured JSON data. The project implements a clean pipeline architecture with modular processors for extraction, segmentation, metadata enrichment, and timeline building.

## Current State Assessment

### Project Strengths
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized separation of concerns with `models`, `processors`, and `utils`
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Strong test coverage with unit, integration, and HTML coverage reports
- **Modern Python Tooling**: Uses `pyproject.toml`, `ruff`, `black`, `mypy`, and `pytest` with proper configuration
- **Type Safety**: Fully typed codebase with mypy enforcement
- **Documentation**: Multiple documentation files and clear code structure
- **Working Pipeline**: Functional 5-step processing pipeline with proper logging

### Current Implementation
- **PDFExtractor**: Handles PDF text extraction
- **DocumentSegmenter**: Segments documents into logical sections
- **MetadataExtractor**: Enriches segments with metadata (dates, types, providers)
- **TimelineBuilder**: Creates chronological timelines from processed segments
- **Command-line Interface**: Supports input/output paths and verbose logging

### Areas for Enhancement
- **Configuration Management**: Settings are currently hardcoded in processors
- **Error Handling**: Could benefit from more robust error recovery
- **Performance**: Single-document processing, no batch capabilities
- **Deployment**: No containerization or production deployment setup
- **API Access**: Limited to command-line interface

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Enhancement

**Goal**: Strengthen the foundation and improve maintainability

**Priority Tasks:**
1. **Configuration Management System**
   - Create `config.yaml` or `.env` file for centralized settings
   - Replace hardcoded values in processors with configurable parameters
   - Add validation for configuration values

2. **Enhanced Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Implement comprehensive exception handling across all processors
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - Create detailed error reporting and logging

3. **Processor Interface Formalization**
   - Create abstract base class (`ProcessorABC`) with standardized interface
   - Ensure all processors implement consistent `process()` method signatures
   - Add processor metadata and capabilities registration

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement memory-efficient processing for large documents
   - Add progress tracking and estimation
   - Optimize text extraction and segmentation algorithms

### Phase 2: Feature Expansion & Usability

**Goal**: Add powerful features and improve user experience

**Priority Tasks:**
1. **REST API Development**
   - Create FastAPI-based web service with `/process` endpoint
   - Add file upload handling and async processing
   - Implement proper request/response validation with Pydantic
   - Add API documentation with OpenAPI/Swagger

2. **Batch Processing Capabilities**
   - Add directory-based batch processing via CLI
   - Implement concurrent processing with configurable worker pools
   - Add progress tracking and resumable processing for large batches

3. **Web Interface Development**
   - Create simple Streamlit-based UI for document upload and processing
   - Add real-time processing status and progress visualization
   - Implement results viewer with JSON formatting and export options

4. **Enhanced Output Formats**
   - Add CSV and Excel export options
   - Implement customizable output templates
   - Add summary statistics and processing reports

### Phase 3: Production Deployment & Operations

**Goal**: Prepare for production deployment and enterprise use

**Priority Tasks:**
1. **Containerization & Orchestration**
   - Create optimized Dockerfile with multi-stage builds
   - Add docker-compose setup for local development
   - Implement health checks and graceful shutdown

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
   - Add quality gates with coverage thresholds and security scanning
   - Implement automated dependency updates with Dependabot

3. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Add structured logging with configurable levels
   - Implement metrics collection and health monitoring
   - Create alerting for processing failures and performance issues

4. **Security & Compliance**
   - Add input validation and sanitization
   - Implement secure file handling and temporary file cleanup
   - Add audit logging for compliance requirements

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future Considerations)

**Goal**: Add AI/ML capabilities and advanced integrations

**Potential Features:**
- Machine learning-based document classification
- Advanced NLP for entity extraction and relationship mapping
- Integration with cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
- Advanced analytics and reporting dashboard
- Multi-language support and internationalization
