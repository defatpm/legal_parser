# Plan to Fix Syntax Errors and Improve CI

This document outlines the plan to fix the syntax error in `src/utils/error_handler.py` and prevent similar issues in the future.

## Plan

1.  **Fix the syntax error:** Apply the suggested fix in `src/utils/error_handler.py`.
2.  **Run local tests:** To ensure the fix works and doesn't introduce new errors.
3.  **Lint the code:** To find and fix other potential syntax errors.
4.  **Review CI configuration:** Analyze the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to see if linting and type checking are part of the CI pipeline. If not, add them.
5.  **Commit the changes:** Once all the steps are completed and the code is working, commit the changes with a descriptive message.
